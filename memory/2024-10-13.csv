1. The keyword `JOINs` should be `JOIN`.
2. The equality operator should be a single `=` instead of `==`.

Hereâ€™s the corrected SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
    midyear.country_name, 
    midyear.midyear_population, 
    growth.growth_rate
FROM
    bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_international.midyear_population AS midyear
JOIN
    bigquery-public-data.census_bureau_international.birth_death_growth_rates AS growth
ON 
    growth.country_name = midyear.country_name
    AND growth.year = midyear.year
WHERE 
    midyear.year = 1975
ORDER BY 
    midyear.country_name;
```

Make sure to replace `country_name` and `year` with the correct column names if they differ in your actual database schema. Let me know if you need further assistance!"
